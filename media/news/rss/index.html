      <title>PyCon Australia needs volunteers!</title>
      <link>http://2013.pycon-au.org/media/news/37</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;With just ten days until the start of PyCon Australia 2013, it’s time
for us to call for volunteers -- we need your support to make PyCon AU a
huge success. Over the course of the conference we will be needing
session chairs, people to man the registration desk and general volunteers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Session chairs and only need to commit to being in one room
between two breaks (e.g. from the end of morning tea through the
beginning of lunch).  You can take up these roles and still see all of
the talks in one room for a session -- just nominate which sessions
you&#39;d be happy to chair in your reply and we&#39;ll try to allocate you to
them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Session chairs are responsible for managing one room for a block of
presentations between two breaks. Their job is to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Introduce the speakers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Keep speakers on time&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ensure the session is kept in order&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Passing the audience microphone to questioners (this helps make sure
our video recordings are of a very high quality).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our registration desk will be open on Friday morning, Friday night and
Saturday morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need four volunteers to make short work of the 300+ delegates that
we are expecting. Outside of those rush hours we’d like to keep the
desk manned to answer delegate queries and deal with late check-ins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, any volunteers who can be on call throughout the conference
to assist the organisers would be greatly appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who can make it, we plan on running a briefing session on
Friday afternoon, sometime around 1:00pm (time to be confirmed).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;re interested in volunteering for any of the roles that we&#39;ve
described above, please reply to &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:contact@pycon-au.org&#34;&gt;contact@pycon-au.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We look forward to hearing from you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;--PyCon AU 2013 Organising team.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mark Pesce and MooresCloud brings the Internet of Things to PyCon Australia</title>
      <link>http://2013.pycon-au.org/media/news/36</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A world where every device we interact with is aware of our surroundings, and is reacting to them. That&#39;s the promise of the Internet of Things. As computers that can run Python get smaller, the prospect of building intelligent, connected, world-aware devices is becoming more real for Python Programmers. To help explain where Python fits into the Internet of Things, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.moorescloud.com&#34;&gt;MooresCloud&lt;/a&gt; Co-Founder and CEO, Mark Pesce, will be joining PyCon Australia 2013 as its dinner keynote presenter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;float: right;&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/images/news_images/pesce.jpg&#34; width=&#34;250px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inspired by the promise of the Internet of Things, MooresCloud have for the past year set themselves to work on producing intelligent, internet-aware devices. They&#39;re also huge fans of Open Source, and Python in particular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Holiday, MooresCloud&#39;s flagship device outwardly looks like a harmless string of Christmas lights. Under the hood, it&#39;s a fully-fledged Linux-based computer, it connects to the Internet using WiFi, and best of all, it&#39;s fully programmable using Python. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To help connect Holiday and the Australian Python community, Mark will be at the conference, both to lead a sprint on &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.moorescloud.com/2013/02/21/introducing-iotas/&#34;&gt;IoTAS&lt;/a&gt;, the software that drives Holiday, but also to run hacking sessions on Holiday itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&#39;re looking forward to it!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Revealing the PyCon Australia 2013 Programme</title>
      <link>http://2013.pycon-au.org/media/news/31</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Now that we&#39;ve announced both of our keynote presenters, PyCon Australia is very proud to be able to reveal the &lt;a href=&#34;http://2013.pycon-au.org/programme/schedule/saturday&#34;&gt;rest of the programme for the 2013 conference&lt;/a&gt;, to be held on Saturday 6 and Sunday 7 July 2013, following DjangoCon AU and the PyCon AU OpenStack Miniconf on Friday 5 July 2013 in Hobart, Tasmania.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following a record-breaking response to our Call for Proposals the conference will feature three full tracks of presentations and tutorials, across two days, covering all aspects of the Python ecosystem, presented by experts and core developers of key Python technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our keynote presenters, &lt;a href=&#34;http://2013.pycon-au.org/media/news/24&#34;&gt;Alex Gaynor, software engineer at Rdio and core contributor to many Python open source projects&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://2013.pycon-au.org/media/news/27&#34;&gt;Tennessee Leeuwenburg, software engineer at the Australian Bureau of Meteorology&lt;/a&gt; will be joined by a wide array of presenters covering a broad range of backgrounds, including industry, research, government and academia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As ever, PyCon Australia is a great place to keep up-to-date with the latest trends in Python web technology: Django lead developer, Jacob Kaplan-Moss will be presenting on &lt;a href=&#34;http://2013.pycon-au.org/schedule/30081/view_talk?day=saturday&#34;&gt;Building secure web apps: Python vs the OWASP Top 10&lt;/a&gt;. As well as DjangoCon AU, the main conference will feature talks on testing, deployment, and optimisation of Python-based web apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the first time, we&#39;ve packed out an entire stream of talks on using Python in the Sciences. Centred around Edward Schofield&#39;s tutorial, &lt;a href=&#34;http://2013.pycon-au.org/schedule/30079/view_talk?day=sunday&#34;&gt;Modern scientific computing and big data analytics in Python&lt;/a&gt;, there are also talks on the amazingly versatile IPython Notebook, and the Pandas numerical library.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&#39;ve also made sure that beginners, or people looking to brush up on their Python skillset, have a clear path through the conference. Starting with Peter Lovett&#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://2013.pycon-au.org/schedule/30088/view_talk?day=saturday&#34;&gt;Python 102&lt;/a&gt; tutorial, you can rapidly enhance your knowledge of Python, and then you can attend our general stream talks to glean a snapshot of the state of the art in Python.&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The full schedule for PyCon Australia 2013 can be found at &lt;a href=&#34;http://2013.pycon-au.org/programme/schedule/saturday&#34;&gt;http://2013.pycon-au.org/programme/schedule/saturday&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Registrations for PyCon Australia 2013 are now open, with prices starting at AU$44 for students, and tickets for the general public starting at AU$198.  All prices include GST, and more information can be found at &lt;a href=&#34;http://2013.pycon-au.org/register/prices&#34;&gt;http://2013.pycon-au.org/register/prices&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&#39;re looking forward to seeing this excellent programme brought to life at PyCon Australia 2013, in Hobart, in July.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Solve your problems with Python - Tennessee Leeuwenburg joins PyCon Australia 2013 as a keynote presenter</title>
      <link>http://2013.pycon-au.org/media/news/27</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;PyCon Australia, the national conference for the Python programming community is happy to announce that Tennessee Leeuwenburg, one of the veterans of the Australian Python community will be joining the 2013 conference as a keynote presenter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;float: right;&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/images/news_images/tennessee_leeuwenburg.jpg&#34; width=&#34;250px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PyCon Australia 2013 will be held in Hobart, Tasmania on Saturday 6 and Sunday 7 July, 2013, following DjangoCon AU and the OpenStack Miniconf on Friday 5 July.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a long-time software developer at the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, and currently a leader of the software development team responsible for the first draft of most Australian weather forecasts, Tennessee has a long history of translating between programmers and the requirements of experts outside the field of Computer Science:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&#34;The tools of developer teams, like revision control and code reviews are great for software quality, but not everyone outside your team will know how to work with them.&#34;&lt;/em&gt;, Tennessee says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there is another way: &lt;em&gt;&#34;By using a variety of techniques and technologies, you can tap into the expert knowledge of others more effectively&#34;&lt;/em&gt;, Tennessee notes. &lt;em&gt;&#34;Tools such as sharing gists, demonstration sessions and screencasts, along with emerging Python tools like the iPython Notebook are a great way to get others involved in problem solving.&#34;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&#34;Knowing how to use these tools quickly and effectively can also be a great way to explain problems to management, or to walk them through a complex requirement.&#34;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A long-time member of the Australian Python community, Tennessee is on the editorial team of The Python Papers; his interests include artificial intelligence and automation, topics he has presented at every PyCon Australia since the first conference in 2010, and before that, numerous Open Source Developer Conferences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&#39;re looking forward to hearing Tennessee&#39;s keynote, which is sure to be a great insight into bridging the divide between developers and pepople from outside the field, at PyCon Australia in July. Conference registrations are now open at &lt;a href=&#34;http://2013.pycon-au.org/register/prices&#34;&gt;http://2013.pycon-au.org/register/prices&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>PyCon Australia introduces wide-ranging financial aid programme</title>
      <link>http://2013.pycon-au.org/media/news/26</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Following in the footsteps of PyCon North America, PyCon Australia is introducing a generous financial aid programme, so that some attendees and speakers have some, or in rare cases, all of their expenses such as flight, hotel and admission provided to them from the conference bud­get.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PyCon Australia strongly encourages people to apply for financial aid -- even if we can’t cover all of your expenses, we will give you free admission based on need. The application process is simple, and straight­ for­ward. It’s also very liberal -- the only caveat is that speakers at the conference &#34;get bumped to the top&#34; of the applications so that we don’t lose a good talk because of financial need. We also don’t ban any­one from apply­ing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essentially, the financial aid programme is the PyCon Outreach program - it&#39;s the community holding up the community and making itself accessible at this major event through these financial grants. It is the very spirit of the conference; make the information, knowledge, friendships and connection available to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The generous contribution of the Python Software Foundation has helped us in kicking off this programme. Financial aid is core to the mission of the PSF -- The mission of the Python Software Foundation is to promote, protect, and advance the Python programming language, and to support and facilitate the growth of a diverse (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.python.org/psf/diversity/&#34;&gt;http://www.python.org/psf/diversity/&lt;/a&gt;) and international community of Python programmers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google Australia has also generously contributed to the financial aid programme, so that we can increase the pool of financial aid available to deserving women, in order to help reduce the barriers to attending PyCon Australia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To apply for financial aid to attend PyCon Australia, applicants must fill out the application form found at, &lt;a href=&#34;http://2013.pycon-au.org/grants&#34;&gt;http://2013.pycon-au.org/grants&lt;/a&gt; - the first round of aid applications will be awarded after Friday 17 May.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h4&gt;Eligibility&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone interested in attending PyCon Australia is eligible to apply for financial aid. Grants are allocated on the basis of need, and applications will be assessed by our financial aid panel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cases that will be looked upon favourably include, but are not limited to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Presenters with accepted proposals, who would otherwise not be able afford to attend the conference.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Contributors to Python Open Source projects, looking to participate in the post-conference sprints.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Members of Python-related user groups, looking to bring knowledge back to their local community.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Members of groups that encourage diversity in computing and technology, including PyLadies groups, looking to bring knowledge back to their local community.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Students interested in Python, who can contribute knowledge of Python back to their peers.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Teachers looking to contribute knowledge of the state of the art in Python back to their students.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, anyone whose attendance at PyCon Australia will help improve the Python community in Australia, or around the world, is invited to apply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more information on the grants programme, and for information on how to apply, see our financial aid programme page: &lt;a href=&#34;http://2013.pycon-au.org/grants&#34;&gt;http://2013.pycon-au.org/grants&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Alex Gaynor to present keynote at PyCon Australia 2013</title>
      <link>http://2013.pycon-au.org/media/news/24</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;With half of our Early Bird tickets sold, we&#39;re very pleased to announce core Django, PyPy, and CPython developer Alex Gaynor as the first of our keynote presenters for PyCon Australia 2013, to be held on July 6--7, alongside DjangoCon AU on July 5, in Hobart, Tasmania.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;float: right;&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/images/news_images/alex_gaynor.jpg&#34; width=&#34;250px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s hard to find members of the Python community with more diverse interests than Alex. As well as his contributions to Python and Django, he works as a Software Engineer at Rdio; he&#39;s also responsible for Topaz, a Ruby implementaton (completely written in Python, of course).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These interests have led him to wonder about the type of work programmers do: &lt;em&gt;&#34;Are we engineers? Are we scientists? Craftspeople? Something else entirely? Are software engineers, software developers, software architects, and programmers all really the same thing?&#34;&lt;/em&gt;, asks
Alex. &lt;em&gt;&#34;My keynote explores the nature of our work as programmers, and its relationship to the scientific method.&#34;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as being a regular presenter at Python conferences all over the world, Alex serves as a board member of the Django Software Foundation and as a member of the Python Software Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We at PyCon Australia can&#39;t wait to hear Alex&#39;s insights on the role of the prorgrammer in July! Registration is open at &lt;a href=&#34;http://2013.pycon-au.org&#34;&gt;http://2013.pycon-au.org&lt;/a&gt; with Early Bird rates available to the first 80 paid delegates, or until Friday 3 May, 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>PyCon Australia Miniconfs announce Calls for Proposals</title>
      <link>http://2013.pycon-au.org/media/news/18</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;PyCon Australia 2013 will be hosting two one-day miniconfs on Friday 5 July before the main conference proceedings kick off on Saturday 6 July. Miniconfs are events that focus on a specific community that relies heavily on Python, and allows practitioners in those communities to explore those topics in a much deeper way than the main PyCon conference can allow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year, we&#39;re featuring the first ever DjangoCon AU, presented by the Django Software Foundation, as well as a miniconf for the OpenStack cloud platform, presented by Aptira.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both miniconfs have recently announced their call for proposals, so read on to find out more about how you can submit your talks!&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;OpenStack Day&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A chance for developers and users of one of the most important new Python-based open source projects, the OpenStack day is calling for proposals for short talks, in-depth discussions, and lightning talks about all aspects of the OpenStack cloud platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are a developer working on the OpenStack code base, a service provider, vendor, university or corporation deploying OpenStack or a software developer or integrator building apps for deployment on OpenStack then this Miniconf is for you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CFP for the OpenStack Miniconf is open now and closes on &lt;strong&gt;15 April, 2013&lt;/strong&gt;. 
To submit a presentation, visit the &lt;a href=&#34;http://aptira.wufoo.com/forms/pyconau2013-openstack-miniconf-call-for-presenters/&#34;&gt;OpenStack Miniconf CFP site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;DjangoCon AU&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DjangoCon AU is running for the first time as part of PyCon Australia 2013. This miniconf lets developers spend a day diving deeply into the internals, new features, and development practices of the web framework they rely upon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DjangoCon AU is running its call for proposals as part of the PyCon Australia CFP, with all Django-related proposals being considered as part of the programme for PyCon Australia or DjangoCon AU. Proposals close on &lt;strong&gt;Friday 5 April, 2013&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To submit a proposal, visit the &lt;a href=&#34;http://2013.pycon-au.org/programme/call_for_proposals&#34;&gt;PyCon Australia CFP&lt;/a&gt; (registration required).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Now with three days of talks!&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2013, before the main event kicks off, we&#39;re welcoming two new
mini-conferences on the Friday 5 July.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DjangoCon AU is Australia&#39;s first national gathering for developers
using the Django Web Framework. Presented by the Django Software
Foundation, this mini-conference will feature a day of Django-specific
talks and tutorials to support the growing community of Australian
Django Developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Python on OpenStack day is a day of in-depth talks and tutorials
covering the OpenStack cloud platform - one of the most important
growing Open Source Python projects - for Python developers.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h4&gt;Help shape our programme&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every year, we strive to bring the best of Python from around
Australia to the one place, but we can always use some help to find
the Python topics that you want to see at PyCon Australia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there&#39;s a topic that you really want to see at PyCon Australia, or
there&#39;s a speaker who you think we really need to have on our
programme, then head over to our topic or speaker suggestion form, and
let us know all about it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Submit a speaker or topic suggestion: &lt;a href=&#34;http://tinyurl.com/pyconau2013-suggestions&#34;&gt;http://tinyurl.com/pyconau2013-suggestions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h4&gt;Dates &amp; Venue&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&#39;ll be opening our Call for Proposals in late February, and we&#39;ll be
closing it in early April.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early Bird registration will open towards the end of March, and will
run through April. Registration will remain open until close to the
conference opening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conference will be held in July, where we&#39;re moving into a bigger,
better venue at the Wrest Point Convention Centre in Hobart. The
Miniconfs will be held on Friday 5 July, the conference proceedings
are on Saturday 6 &amp; Sunday 7 July, and the post-conference sprints
will be on Monday 8 &amp; Tuesday 9 July.&lt;/p&gt;
